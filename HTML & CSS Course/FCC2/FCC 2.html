          Nikola Tesla accomplished more in his lifetime than many of us could
          ever hope to achieve in a 100 lifetimes. Tesla held over 300 different
          patents, spanning several countries. From wireless technology to
          alternating current, electric motors, Radio, X-Rays, radar and laser
          technologyâ€¦the list goes on. Nikola Tesla's work would go on to
          inspire thousands of inventors, dreamers and engineers. To this very
          day, his inventions continue to shape life as we know it. You can't
          help but wonder what the world would have looked like today if Nikola
          Tesla would have been able to finish his experiments with free energy
          and long range wireless energy transfer.

            <span class="bold">1859</span> - Nikola Tesla is born <br />
            Nikola Tesla is believed to have been born at midnight. During his
            birth, lightning struck during a summer storm. Born to a Serbian
            Family in Smiljan, Tesla was nicknamed `Child of the Storm`, by his
            aunt. That said, his mother replied to that comment by calling him
            `Child of the light`. <br />

          <li>
            <span class="bold">1870</span> - Tesla's Brush With Death <br />
            Nikola Tesla moved to a place known as Karlovac to complete his high
            school. Three years later, he went back to Smiljan and shortly after
            his arrival; he contracted cholera. He was in hospital for close to
            one year, and he faced near-death circumstances.

            <span class="bold">1875</span> - Tesla Enrolls In College <br />
            In 1875, Tesla enrolled to a Polytechnic based on a military
            scholarship. He was a disciplined student and achieved the highest
            grades possible while passing various exams.

            <span class="bold">1880</span> - Tesla Moves To Prague To Study
            Philosophy <br />
            Tesla's uncle collected money to help him relocate to Prague to
            finish his studies. He arrived late to enroll for classes, and his
            lack of competence in Greek and Czech meant that he did not qualify
            for the classes he wanted to take. Instead, he took up classes in
            Philosophy at the university, though he did not receive grades for
            the courses.

            <span class="bold">1881</span> - Tesla Begins His Career As Chief
            Electrical Engineer <br />
            In 1881, he moved to Budapest in Hungary, to work for a telegraph
            company. Upon arriving, he noticed that the Budapest Telephone
            Exchange company was not in operation, so he worked at draftsman in
            another company. A few months later, the BTS Company was in
            operation, and he was given the position of chief electrical
            engineer. During his tenure, he introduced various operation
            upswings which improved the performance of the company.

            <span class="bold">1882</span> - Tesla Goes To Work For Edison
            <br />
            In 1882, he found another job in Paris with a company referred to as
            the Continental Edison Company.

            <span class="bold">1885 </span> - Tesla Submits Some Of His First
            Patents <br />
            In March 1885, he met with an attorney known as Lemuel Serrel, to
            help in the submission of various patents. Serrel introduced Tesla
            to various businessmen, including Benjamin Vail and Robert Lane.

            <span class="bold">1887</span> - Tesla Re-imagines The Electric
            Motor <br />
            In 1887, Tesla came up with an induction motor that was operated by
            alternating current, a form of power that was becoming common in
            Europe and the USA. This type of power provided various benefits,
            especially in long-distance power transmission. In particular, the
            motor was operated by a polyphase current, which produced a rotating
            magnetic field to operate the motor.

            <span class="bold">1890</span> - Tesla Begins His Work On Wireless
            Power Transmission <br />
            After 1890, Tesla researched various approaches to transmitting
            power by inductive and capacitive coupling. This was through the use
            of AC voltages that were produced by his famous `Tesla coil.`

            In mid 1891, at the age of 35, he became a naturalized citizen of
            the US. In the same year, he also patented his famous Tesla Coil.

            <span class="bold">1943</span> - Tesla's Death <br />
            In early 1943, at age 86, Tesla died in a Hotel Room in New York. He
            died alone, and his body was found by a maid who ignored a do not
            disturb sign on Tesla's room. The assistant medical professional
            evaluated the body and determined the cause of death was related to
            coronary complications.
